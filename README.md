# GuysDrinking
3-D animation in which 2 guys will be drinking around a table. 
It includes 1 table, 2 chairs, 2 stick men and 2 coffee mugs. 
The figures will speak with each other as long as the program continues.
2  guys will be sitting across a  table on a  chair and drink coffee one by one.
Both guys will have a mug in their hands and drink the coffee on the mug one by one. 
When one of them takes a sip from the mug and puts the mug back on the table,  the other one will hold and raise the mug, take a sip, and put it back. 
This will continue until the coffee inside the mugs is finished. 
As soon as the coffee finishes, you should stop the program loop. The mugs will be designed as cylinders  (closed at the bottom). Inside the mugs, there will be some coffee  (which can be shaped like a  brown sphere). 
Each time the guy takes a  sip,  the size of the coffee will decrease.  

•The mugs have teammates' pictures on them.
•The coffee inside the mug creates smoke.
